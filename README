A simple Jabber (visit http://www.jabber.org/) client using the GTK+ 2.0 toolkit.

To build, you need:
 * Loudmouth (http://www.imendio.com/projects/loudmouth/)
 * GTK+ 2.0 (http://www.gtk.org/)
 * Libglade-2.0
 * libXML (needed by libglade or loudmouth ;-))

This is still a beta release, so it contains probably A LOT OF bugs:-)
 
Enjoy!
